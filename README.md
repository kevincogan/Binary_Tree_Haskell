# Binary_Tree_Haskell

I have created a binary search tree in Haskell programming language. I have also added three function to change the binary search tree:

1.  Insert: this inserts nodes into the binary tree. 
2.  Search: This searches if the desired node is in the binary tree returning true or flase.
3.  Retrieval of nodes: we can retrieve the node in different orders such as preorder, inorder, and postorder.
